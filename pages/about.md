## Dionysian Figures in Welty’s Fiction

{% include feature/image.html objectid="coll023" width="50" caption=false %}

Nestled among a plethora of other skillfully executed literary techniques lie the many mythological allusions and symbols in Welty’s fiction. Most, if not all, the stories in The Wide Net reference either mythology or folklore, and such references span across various cultures and subjects. As such, significant scholarly work has been done in the analyzation of her symbols, some of which are still debated by various readers. Welty herself has written about her appreciation for and utilization of myth, though she also cautions readers not to force any of them too directly onto her work (Brower 5, 13). However, interpreting her stories within this framework reveals layers of literary value and adds complexity and depth to her fiction. Since it would prove quite impossible to cover the extent of her use of myth and folklore in one article, this essay will cover the specific role of Dionysian figures in Welty’s stories from The Wide Net.

Dionysian figures are those who exhibit certain traits or fulfill certain roles derived from the Greek god Dionysus (“Dionysian”). Dionysus, also called Bacchus or Liber Pater, was the god of wine, fertility, and ecstasy. He was associated with nature, animals, and wild parties; the Cult of Dionysus would hold elaborate festivals in the god’s honor. These festivals were notorious for involving heavy drinking, excessive revelry, sexual activity, and sometimes brief insanity during which some attendants reportedly were capable of violent acts. Many festivals, especially those referred to as the Bacchanalia, were secretive and attended almost exclusively by women (“Dionysus”). In literature, then, Dionysian figures are characters, usually male, that may reflect such aspects as vigor, nature, drinking, and sexuality. They often appear in relation to animals or exhibit a youthful vitality (“Dionysian”).

Such characters appear three notable times in The Wide Net. In addition, while the titular story does not necessarily contain a strict Dionysian figure, it does contain events that apparently relate to Dionysian fertility rites. “The Wide Net” describes a journey into the natural world, where events like feasts, fights, and challenges take place. These occurrences, combined with the fact that Hazel Jameson is pregnant, denote celebrations of nature, wildness, and vitality (Brower 22).

The first clear Dionysian figure the reader encounters in the collection is Don McInnis in “Asphodel.” Three women, Cora, Phoebe, and Irene, venture into the woods to picnic near the ruins of a mansion that mysteriously burned down. They recount the forced marriage between Sabina, their former employer, and a man called Don McInnis, who Sabina drove away after learning that he cheated on her. At the end, Don McInnis himself appears in the ruins, completely naked and surrounded by goats, which chase the ladies out of the glade.

The Dionysian imagery appears early in the story, and not exclusively in terms of Don McInnis. The food and drink the ladies bring allude to those commonly associated with Dionysus, including grapes and wine (Welty 242). The Dionysian myths involve a cult of women followers, often called maenads, who were susceptible to insane frenzy while worshipping him (Koontz 3-4). The ladies describe McInnis as animalistic, drunken, and having “the wildness we all worshipped” (Welty 243-244). McInnis as Dionysus indicates that Sabina is one of those women driven mad by the god, an allusion reinforced by the fact that her behavior is described by the ladies as often strange and erratic. Also, before she dies, she tears apart letters (248), which could allude to the story of maenads becoming so deranged that they tear apart people and animals (“Dionysus”). The appearance of McInnis at the end of the story matches features that are attributed to images of Dionysus as well. McInnis appears nude and bearded (Welty 249); early Greek depictions often portrayed Dionysus as bearded (Koontz 3), and the nudity corresponds to his attributes of virility and sexuality. The herd of goats that appears corresponds to the satyrs, figures of Greek mythology who were also associated with fertility and were said to follow Dionysus (“Dionysus”). McInnis’s appearance and behavior combined with the natural scenery, goats, and food and drink allude to various aspects of Dionysian myths, making “Asphodel” a prime example of Welty’s utilization of mythology.

The next story in the collection that involves a Dionysian figure is “Livvie.” This story tells how Livvie, a young girl married to a much older man, has been secluded in the woods and takes care of her husband as he nears death. At one point she encounters a young field hand named Cash. His bright, cheery youthfulness catches Livvie’s attention. They go into the house, where Solomon sees them and, right before dying, recognizes that Cash will become Livvie’s new partner.

Cash, through his association with spring, nature, and youthful male vigor, encompasses Dionysian qualities. The story takes place at the beginning of spring, a season associated with masculinity in the story, such as in the line that spring “was as present in the house as a young man would be” (Welty 280). When Cash appears, his colorful clothes are described through comparisons to nature, like his “leaf-green” coat (285). Cash entrances Livvie with his vitality and activeness, and she kisses him even before Solomon’s death (286). At the end, after Solomon has died, they stand together looking outside, where everything shines “with the bursting light of spring” (290). Since Cash is associated with spring, nature, vitality, and even sensuality, he becomes a Dionysian figure that poses a sharp contrast to the old and withered Solomon and indicates a fresh start for Livvie.

The third story, “At the Landing,” features a man named Billy Floyd as the Dionysian figure. In this story, Jenny lives a secluded life with her grandfather, who soon dies. Jenny, no doubt influenced by her feelings of loss and isolation, fixates on Floyd, a man whose origins are unknown and who seems to be just passing through the area. When a flood sweeps through the Landing, Floyd rescues her but then violates her. Jenny still holds on to her strange feelings of love for him, however, and pursues him to the Mississippi River. The story ends with her waiting for him on the bank while the fishermen take turns violating her.

Despite the lyrical tone and beautiful nature descriptions in “At the Landing,” it is a grim, complex story. Floyd encompasses some of the darker aspects of Dionysian myth, such as the influence the god’s inspiration supposedly had on the mental state of his female worshippers (“Dionysus”). In the beginning the character is referred to as “the rude wild Floyd” (Welty 294). He inspires in Jenny a strange fascination that she believes is love for him, although he does nothing to reciprocate this affection. Perhaps their interactions together might be seen as a twisted version of a Dionysian ceremony. Floyd and Jenny interact while immersed in nature, whether in the open field near the cemetery or during the flood. Floyd’s violation, and later the fishermen’s violation, of Jenny could relate to the sexual rituals said to take place at the festivals. Finally, the meal that Jenny and Floyd have after he assaults her could translate to the feasts had at the ceremonies. The story vaguely mentions that Jenny’s mother suffered from a “wild desire” that Jenny’s grandfather saw as “a force of Nature” (293-294), so perhaps Jenny’s fixation on Floyd is not a singular type of incident in her family. Perhaps her mother too was influenced by a Dionysian madness, and the grandfather, much like the men in ancient times who opposed women’s worship of the Greek god, tried to stifle those emotions (“Dionysus”).

Other smaller details point to Floyd as a Dionysian figure as well. For example, Jenny watches him through a tangle of grape vines (Welty 295). Several times throughout the story, Floyd is related to nature and animals. He skillfully and easily rides the horse in the pasture and goes off into the woods, rejoining the wild (297). The old ladies at the Landing say that Floyd “could scent coming things like an animal” (309). Floyd is also associated with the river, a powerful force that corresponds to his connection with nature and his influence over Jenny. In his dream, her grandfather seemed to think that Floyd could predict the river’s floods (291), yet again giving him a mysterious influence over the things around him. Emphasized throughout the story, the combination of Floyd’s deep connection with nature and his strange power over Jenny indicates that Floyd is a well-developed yet troubling Dionysian figure.

As evidenced by the analyses of these stories from The Wide Net, Welty was a master at utilizing mythological elements to take already interesting and complex stories and place them in a larger literary and cultural context through recognizable symbols and allusions. In “Asphodel,” “Livvie,” “At the Landing,” and even a little in “The Wide Net,” Welty explores the idea of the Dionysian figure and how such a character interacts with the people and environments around him. Since these stories also feature questions of sexual and romantic relationships and a profound connection to nature, Dionysian figures serve to further deepen the exploration into these themes. Though the scope of Welty’s mythological allusions is certainly not limited to this subject, her use of the myth of Dionysus and his wild revelries takes the reader on a revealing journey of connections between character, setting, and the ancient stories humans still tell about themselves.
