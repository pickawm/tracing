coll001,coll001.pdf,,,Life and Adventures of John A. Murrell,H. Long & Brother,1848,"""The conflict between himself and Drayton was a most unfortunate affair, and, view it in any phase he might, was sure to result, more or less, disastrously to his interests. He did not dread an information from the hands of Drayton’s friends, for, however bitterly they might resent their leader’s overthrow, he was well aware that their professional souls would disdain a legal vengeance; but the fight had taken place in the presence of several abandoned women, who, in their eagerness to acquit themselves of any blame, would tell every detail, and not only give the name of its principal actor, but also put the officers upon his haunts. He, therefore, dared not to go to his hotel, even for a change of clothes; and, added to the other evils of his predicament, he found himself with but two or three dollars in his pocket. In this dilemma he resolved, after a few moments pause, to run half a mile farther up the bank, to  the house of a friendly speculator, and obtain from him the necessary clothing and means to get away. The man whom he selected was just the one who was calculated, above all others, to supply his wants, for he was a receiver of stolen goods, who had obtained many a profitable ‘swag’ from Murrell’s hands, and his ample store of second-hand apprell was sure to furnish a ready and complete supply to the fugitive robber’s wants.</div><div><br /></div><div>&quot;Taking from this man a prim-cut coat, a broad brim hat, half a dozen white neckcloths, a bible, a double-barrelled pistol, and a heavy knife, Murrell stood prepared to play the preacher or the devil, as the fluctuations of his fortune might require; and after storing them away in a small valise, and obtaining a sum of twenty dollars from the receiver, as a loan, he sat down and wrote a letter, directing his brother to meet him at Natchez. He and his friend then started for the shore, and taking a boat, shot down the river with the current, and at midnight parted on the opposite bank—the receiver to return to the city, and the robber to set out toward the north, in the guise of a preacher of the Gospel, and with a forged certificate of probation in his pocket. Availing himself of the information he had obtained during his recent residence in New Orleans, of the haunts of the associates of the clans to which Phelps and Haines belonged, Murrell found in Ibberville a friendly gang of counterfeiters, who, on the presentation of his credentials, readily admitted him to their confidence, and supplied him with a large amount of counterfeit money to aid him in his northern progress. In return, they only asked for payment for the boodle, his personal due bill, which they filed among the rest of their accounts, to await the chance when his affairs should be in a more flourishing condition. With three or four hundred dollars, mostly in spurious tens and twenties, the desperate adventurer then set out again, so as to be in Natchez at the appointed time to keep his appointment with his brother. He still kept up his character of Methodist preacher, and, during the course of his journey, delivered several sermons, and indeed lost no opportunity of ingratiating himself with the godly of each village, by a passing exhortation to sinners to seek the blessings of redeeming grace. The result of these amiable little pauses was generally the passing off of several counterfeit notes, which, in consequence of their coming from the very pouch of sanctity itself, were never mistrusted for a moment.""",Murrell,"Natchez, MS",31.5604,-91.4032,Life and Adventures of John A.

Long & Brother,1848,"""On the following day I sold my horse to obtain present means for travel, and set out for Natchez on foot, with the intention of stealing another the first opportunity that offered. No luck turned up during the first four days, and I was growing more and more desperate as I kept getting more and more fatigued and foot-sore, and had not a fortunate chance arose, I would doubtless have been betrayed into some imprudent act of force that would have got me into trouble. On the fifth day, at the heat of noon, I retired to a shady spot on the bank of a creek, to get some water and a little rest.—While I was sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree, looking down the road in the direction I had come, a horseman hove in sight. The very moment this object caught my eye, I determined to have possession of the animal, if his rider should prove to be a traveller. My hopes turned out to be correct. I saw from his equipage, as he drew nearer, that the horseman was prepared for a long journey, and as he approached close to me, I rose from my seat, seized his rein, and drawing a rifle pistol on him, order him to dismount.—He obeyed without a word, and still holding the horse by the bridle, I pointed down the creek to a secluded spot, and ordered him to walk before me. … We went a few hundred yards till we came to a spot well sheltered from observation, when I hitched the horse, and ordered him to undress.  … He stretched his hands imploringly toward me, and begged for time to pray before he died. But this was not in the way of business, so I refused him the favor, and told him I never had time to address heaven for myself, and I was sure I could not find time to hear him pray. He turned from me and dropped upon his knees at this, and I shot him through the back of his head. I felt sorry for him, but I could not help it. I had been obliged to travel on foot for the previous four days, and I now relieved him of the danger of ever suffering the like.""",Murrell,"Natchez, MS",31.5604,-91.4032,Life and Adventures of John A.

I had commenced the foundation of this mystic clan in that tour, and suggested the plan of exciting a rebellion among the negroes as the sure road to an inexhaustible fortune to all who would engage in the expedition. [The first mysic sign which is used by this clan, was in use before I was born, and the second had its origin from myself, Phelps, Haines, Cooper, Dorris, Bolton, Harris, Doddridge, Celly, Morris, Walter, Depont, and one of my brothers, on the second night after my acquaintance with them in New Orleans. We needed a higher order to carry on our designs, and we adopted our sign, and called it the sign of the grand council of the mystic clan, and practised ourselves to give and receive the new sign to a fraction before we parted: and in addition to the improvement, we invented and formed a mode of corresponding by means of ten characters, mixed with other matters, which has been very convenient on many occasions and especially when any of us get into difficulties.] I was encouraged in my new undertaking, and my heart began to beat high with the hope of being able, one day, to visit the pomp of southern and western people in my vengeance; and of seeing their cities and towns one common scene of devastation, smoked walls and fragments.""",Dow,"New Orleans, LA",29.9499,-90.0701,"A history of the detection, conviction, life and designs of John A.

His acquirements and the benevolence of his disposition were such, that when I first met with him, I could not help looking upon him as another Mentor. Although his few remaining locks were grey, his countenance still expressed the gaiety and buoyant feelings of youth. He had the best religious principles; for his heart and his purse were ever open to the poor. Under his guidance it was that I visited the whole neighborhood of Natchez; for he was acquainted with all its history, from the period at which it had first come under the power of the Spaniards to that of their expulsion from the country, its possession by the French, and subsequently by ourselves. He was also well versed in the Indian languages, spoke French with the greatest purity, and was a religious poet. Many a pleasant hour have I spent in his company; but alas! he has gone the way of all the earth!""",Audubon,"Natchez, MS",31.5604,-91.4032,Ornithological Biography,"v. 2, p. 541",text,application/pdf,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

coll010,coll008.pdf,,,Ornithological Biography,John James Audubon,1834,"""One clear frosty morning in December I approached in my flat boat the City of Natchez. The shores were crowded with boats of various kinds, laden with the produce of the western country; and there was a bustle about them, such as you might see at a general fair, each person being intent on securing the advantage of a good market. Yet the scene was far from being altogether pleasing, for I was yet ‘under the hill;’ but on removing from the lower town, I behld the cliffs on which the city, properly so called, has been built. Vultures unnumbered flew close along the ground on expanded pinions, searching for food; large pines and superb magnolias here and there raised their evergreen tops toward the skies; while on the opposite shores of the Mississippi, vast alluvial beds stretched along, and the view terminated with the dense forest. Steamers moved rapidly on the broad waters of the great stream; the sunbeams fell with a peculiarly pleasant effect on the distant objects; and as I watched the motions of the White-headed Eagle while pursuing the Fishing Hawk, I thought of the wonderful ways of that Power to whom I too owe my existence. ... Before reading the land I had observed that several saw-mills were placed on ditches or narrow canals, along which the water rushed from the inner swamps toward the river, and by which the timeber is conveyed to the shore; and on inquiring afterwards, I found that one of those temporary establishments had produced a net profit of upwards of six thousand dollars in a single season. ... There is much romantic scenery about Natchez. The Lower Town forms a most remarkable contrast with the Upper, for in the former the houses were not regularly built, being generally dwellings formed of the abandoned flat boats, placed in rows as if with the view of forming a long street. The inhabitants formed a medley which it is beyond my power to describe; hundreds of laden carts and other vehicles jogged along the declivity between the two towns; but when, by a very rude causeway, I gained the summit, I was relieved by the sight of an avenue of those beautiful trees called here the Pride of China. In the Upper Town I found the streets all laid off at right angles to each other, and tolerably well lined with buildings, constructed with painted bricks or boards.""",Audubon,"Natchez, MS",31.5604,-91.4032,Ornithological Biography,"v. 2, p. 539",text,application/pdf,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

coll012,coll012.pdf,,,Ornithological Biography,John James Audubon,1831,"""There is an extensive Swamp in the section of the State of Mississippi which lies partly in the Choctaw territory. It commences at the borders of the Mississippi, at no great distance from a Chicasaw village, situated near the mouth of a creek known by the name of Vanconnah, and partly inundated by the swellings of several large bayous, the principal of which, crossing the swamp in its whole extent, discharges its waters not far from the mouth of the Yazoo River. This famous bayou is called False River. The swamp of which I am speaking follows the windings of the Yazoo, until the latter branches off to the north-east, and at this point forms the stream named Cold Water River, below which the Yazoo receives the draining of another bayou inclining towards the north-west, and intersecting that known by the name of False River, at a short distance from the place where the latter receives the waters of the Mississippi. This tedious account of the situation of the Swamp, is given with the view of pointing it out to all students of nature who may chance to go that way, and whom I would earnestly urge to visit its interior, as it abounds in rare and interesting productions: birds, quadrupeds and reptiles, as well as molluscous animals, many of which I am persuaded have never been described.""",Audubon,Panther Swamp Wildlife Refuge,32.81267007,-90.58914185,Ornithological Biography,"v. 1, p. 205",text,application/pdf,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

I shall commence with the year 1808, at which time a great portion of the western country, and the banks of the Mississippi River, from above the city of Natchez particularly, were little more than a waste, or, to use words better suited to my feelings, remained in their natural state. To ascend the great stream against a powerful current, rendered still stronger whenever islands occurred, together with the thousands of sand-banks, as liable to changes and shiftings as the alluvial shores themselves, which at every deep curve or bend were seen giving way, as if crushed down by the weight of the great forests that everywhere reached to the very edge of the water, and falling and sinking in the muddy stream, by acres at a time, was an adventure of no small difficulty and risk, and which was rendered more so by the innumerable logs, called sawyers and planters, that everywhere raised their heads above the water, as if bidding defiance to all intruders. Few white inhabitants had yet marched towards its shores, and these few were of a class little able to assist the navigator. Here and there a solitary encampment of native Indians might be seen, but its inmates were as likely to prove foes as friends, having from their birth been made keenly sensible of the encroachments of the white men upon their lands.""",Audubon,"Natchez, MS",31.5604,-91.4032,Ornithological Biography,"v. 1, p. 130",text,application/pdf,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

I set off alone, and rode the best part of twenty miles, when I saw a party of Indians within about a hundred feet of me: I was in hopes they would pass me, but in vain, for the first Indian seized my horse by the bridle, and the others surrounded me. At first, I thought it was a gone case with me, then I concluded to get off my horse and give up all, in order to save my life; but it turned in my mind, that if I do, I must return to the settlements, in order to get equipped for another start, and then it will be too late for my appointments. Again it turned in my mind, how when I was in Ireland, somebody would frequently be robbed or murdered one day, and I would travel the same way the day before or the day after, and yet was preserved and brought back in peace; and the same God is as able to preserve me here and deliver me now as then--immediately I felt the power of faith to put my confidence in God; at the same time I observed the Indians had ramrods in their muzzles of their guns as well as in their stock, so it would take some time to pull out the ramrods, and get the gun cocked and prepared up to their faces, ready to shoot; at this moment, my horse started and jumped sideways, which would have laid the Indian to the ground, who held the bridle, had it not slipped out of his hands; at the same time, the Indian on the other side, jumped seemingly like a streak to keep from under the horse's feet, so that there was a vacancy in the circle; at the same time, I gave my horse the switch, and leaned down in the saddle, so that if they shot I would give them as narrow a chance as I could to hit me, as I supposed they would wish to spare and get my horse.
